# Sample RxKotlin

ReactiveX (Rx) is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable pattern including `Observable` and `Observer`.

| Classes    | Action                                                      |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Observable | Manage the data from source then send it to the `Observer`. |
| Observer   | Receive the data from the `Observable`.                     |

For managing the data in `Observable`, Rx provides the `Operator` including as below.
  - Creating observables
  - Transforming observables
  - Filtering observables
  - Combining observables
  - Error handling operators
  - Observable utility operators
  - Conditional and boolean operators
  - Mathematical and aggregate operators
  - Backpressure operators
  - Connectable observable operators
  - Operators to convert observables

To know the instruction of `Operator`, you can see a sample application demonstrating how to implement it with Rx. It will show you how to use `Operator` in each fragment.
