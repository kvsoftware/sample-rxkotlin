Sample RxKotlin

ReactiveX is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable pattern including Observer and Observable.

The Observer subscribes to the Observable.

(Observable) ====(Data)====> (Observer)

Observable : send data to the Observer.
Observer   : receive the data from the Observable.

For Android development, we can use RxKotlin which is a Kotlin implementation of ReactiveX.

This is sample application demonstrates how to implement the RxKotlin with all operators. It will show you how to use operators in each fragment.
